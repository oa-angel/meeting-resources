# Introduction 

Welcome to the Monday night Islington meeting of Overeaters Anonymous. My name is ______, I’m a _________ and your secretary for this evening.

**We keep members on mute unless they are reading or sharing. If you are reading or sharing  you will need to unmute yourself.** 


## Readings 

> Remember to assign readers prior to the beginning of the meeting

We begin this meeting with three readings. Can someone read...

+ The Preamble
+ 12 Steps of OA
+ OA for today


Some points to note:
+ We suggest that newcomers attend at least 6 meetings before deciding whether OA is right for you 
+ We usually keep a contacts book.  If you would like to share or are looking for a sponsor please type your name and number into the chat box towards the end of the meeting – we'll let you know when it's open.  
+ If you are looking for a sponsor or available to sponsor, you are welcome to add that to the chat box, too.  

At this group we rotate formats. This week it is a ____________ (insert from below list)

> Steps and Traditions are read based on the month (Step 1 - January, etc). Move from Weeks 1-5 in the month. 
> 1. chair on a step
> 2. chair on any topic
> 3. chair on a tradition 
> 4. chair on any topic
> 5. chair on a topic of the secretary's choosing


> Chairs are allotted 10-15 minutes of time. **Secretary to time**

## Chair Speaks

===

# After the Chair

May we have someone to do the time card? 

> Wait for a volunteer

Sharing time is  2 minutes in order that as many people as possible get to share. When your time is up, the time keeper will unmute themselves to say “time” so you know where you are.  

> (Switch to 3 minutes if there are fewer than 15 present)

The last 10 minutes are reserved for newcomers and shy sharers, but if you are new feel free to share at any time, and also do not feel that you have to share.

Remember, our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive overeating and to carry this message of recovery to those who still suffer; therefore feedback, cross talk, and advice-giving are discouraged here.

Cross talk during an OA meeting is giving advice to others who have already shared and speaking directly to another person rather than to the group. If you have any questions about this guidance, please feel free to ask me or another OA member after the meeting, or raise this during our group conscience held the first Monday of the month directly after the meeting.

At this meeting, we raise our hands before sharing using the 'Raise Hand' function in Zoom.  When we open for sharing you can use your raise hand button to share and when you hear your name you can unmute yourself to share. (co-host to re mute members if they forget post sharing)

The meeting is now open for general sharing.

> **7:45 Announce it’s time for newcomers & shy sharers**


# Closing (7.55pm) 

> Open the Chat Function in Zoom

That’s all the time we have for sharing tonight.

According to our 7th tradition we are fully self-supporting through our own contributions. We have set up paypal pool to take 7th tradition contributions, which our treasurer is sharing now. In order to maintain our meeting in Angel after coronavirus restrictions ease, we’ve had to start paying for our venue again. Therefore we’d like to raise £25 a week to cover the costs of the meeting. 

> After the Paypal Pool link has been shared

Please can we have the reading of _____

> Select one of : 
> + Promises 
> + Commitment 
> + What is Abstinence
> + Acceptance
> + Yesterday Today & Tomorrow 

Please remember the anonymity clause – ‘who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, please let it stay here.’

And we close the meeting with the Serenity Prayer.

> Unmute everyone
