Preamble
12 Steps of OA
OA Just for today



Some points to note:
We suggest that newcomers attend at least 6 meetings before deciding whether OA is right for you 
We usually keep a contacts book.  If you would like to share or are looking for a sponsor please type your name and number into the chat box towards the end of the meeting – we'll let you know when it's open.  
If you are looking for a sponsor or available to sponsor, you are welcome to add that to the chat box, too.  

At this group we rotate formats. This week it is a _____________ (Chair gets 10-15 minutes 

week one:  step
week two:  chair
week three: tradition 
week four:  chair
week five:  topic

(CHAIR SPEAKS)

May we have someone to do the time card? Sharing time is  2 minutes in order that as many people as possible get to share. When your time is up, the time keeper will unmute themselves to say “time” so you know where you are.  (*3 minutes if there are fewer than 15 present)
The last 10 minutes are reserved for newcomers and shy sharers, but if you are new feel free to share at any time and do not feel that you have to share.
Remember, our primary purpose is to abstain from compulsive overeating and to carry this message of recovery to those who still suffer.
Feedback, cross talk, and advice-giving are discouraged here.
Cross talk during an OA meeting is giving advice to others who have already shared and speaking directly to another person rather than to the group.
If you have any questions about this tradition/guidance, please feel free to ask me or another OA member after the meeting, or raise this during our group conscience held the first Monday of the month directly after the meeting.
At this meeting, we raise our hands before sharing.  When we open for sharing you can use your raise hand button to share and when you hear your name you can unmute yourself to share. (co-host to re mute members if they forget post sharing)

The meeting is now open for general sharing.

(Announce that it’s time for newcomers / shy sharers at 7:45)


Closing (7.55pm) That’s all the time we have for sharing. According to our 7th tradition we are fully self-supporting through our own contributions. We are in the process of setting up paypal pool to take 7th tradition contributions. You are welcome to support intergroup, OAGB and World Service Office as an individual member. In order to maintain our meeting in Angel after coronavirus, we’ve had to start paying for our venue again. Therefore we’d like to raise £25 a week to cover the costs of the meeting. 





Readings (After pot has been round)
Promises – Commitment – What is Abstinence – Acceptance – Yesterday Today & Tomorrow (secretary’s choice - try to rotate)

Please remember the anonymity clause – ‘who you see here, what you hear here, when you leave here, please let it stay here.’

And we close the meeting with the Serenity Prayer. (all unmuted)
